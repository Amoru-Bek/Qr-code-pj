![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out My firs front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I found all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

## Thank you Front : https://www.frontendmentor.io
